# Nearby

## What is nearby ?

This small repository is the backend part of a personnal project (done on my free time).

Aim of *nearby* is to provide a service to meet nearby friends declared available to have good time (drink a beer, have a philsophical discussion about meaning of life, or any other things ...).

This project come with a fronted part : A mobile application (not yet published, but that will be done one day...).

In this mobile app, anyone can select a list of contacts that he or she wants to appears as "available". See API documentation of [user_available](#post-user_available) function.
If there is a match (this other person is also available, and not so far), this will be notified to the user.

## Why did I do it ?

Firstly to practice Rust, my favorite programming language that I can't use so much at work.
To play with MongoDB and the powerfull of the request we can do with it !

And that's all. I will never publish this application, create a startup, raise some millions dollards, I have no time for that ! I prefer drink beers with my friends !

## API documentation

There are only two methods in the public API :

#### POST user_available 

#### GET contacts_availables_nearby
